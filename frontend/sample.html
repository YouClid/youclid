	    Let \line{AB} be the given finite straight line.
It is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight line \line{AB}.
Describe the circle \circle{BCD} with center \center{A, circle=BCD} and radius \line{AB}.
Again describe the circle \circle{ACE} with center \center{B, circle=ACE} and radius \line{BA}.
Join the straight lines \line{CA} and \line{CB} from the point \point{C} at which the circles cut one another to the points \point{A} and \point{B}.
Now, since the point \point{A} is the center of the circle \circle{CDB}, therefore \line{AC} equals \line{AB}.
Again, since the point \point{B} is the center of the circle \circle{CAE}, therefore \line{BC} equals \line{BA}.
But \line{AC} was proved equal to \line{AB}, therefore each of the straight lines \line{AC} and \line{BC} equals \line{AB}.
And things which equal the same thing also equal one another, therefore \line{AC} also equals \line{BC}.
Therefore the three straight lines \line{AC}, \line{AB}, and \line{BC} equal one another.
Therefore the triangle \triangle{ABC} is equilateral, and it has been constructed on the given finite straight line \line{AB}.
